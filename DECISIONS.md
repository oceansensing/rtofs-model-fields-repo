# Decisions

Dated, irreversible-leaning decisions, one entry each, newest last. The
reasoning lives in `PLAN.md`.

**What counts as one-way in a data repository**: a decision that puts bytes in
readers' hands under a shape they will code against; a decision about which
repository owns a product, since moving one costs a migration in two places;
and a decision that forecloses an upstream.

## D1 — 2026-09-27 — Its own repository, published but not drawn

The RTOFS **fields**, in a repository of its own under the convention every model
follows: **a model splits along the axis that costs bytes** — currents,
fields and, where the model has them, biogeochemistry — and an atmospheric
model has one atmosphere repository. See `espc-model-repo`'s `DECISIONS.md`
D2 for the measurement behind the split.

**Published but not drawn** (the owner, 2026-09-27): the products go to Pages
and R2 on a schedule and the website's map carries no layer for them, while
its status line reports their health. Drawing one later is a change to the
map, not to this repository.

One-way in the ordinary data-repository sense: moving a product between
repositories is cheap in machinery and expensive in everything that points at
it — roots in the contract, origins in the site's config, and the union
`check:docs` holds across origins.

## D2 — 2026-09-27 — Option A: global height and ice, US East temperature, salinity and currents

The global NetCDF files carry no surface temperature, salinity or currents; the US East regional subset does. Option B — those fields globally, from the 437 MB HYCOM binary per step — is the owner's to choose. Published, not drawn.
